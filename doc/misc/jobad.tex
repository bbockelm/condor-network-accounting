(i.e. virtual memory) of the
job in Kbytes.  The initial value is equal to the size of the
executable for non-vm universe jobs, and 0 for vm universe jobs.
When the job writes a checkpoint, the \AdAttr{ImageSize}
attribute is set to the size of the checkpoint file (since the
checkpoint file contains the job's memory image).
A vanilla universe job's \AdAttr{ImageSize} is recomputed
internally every 15 seconds.
How quickly this updated information becomes visible to \Condor{q} is
controlled by \MacroNI{SHADOW\_QUEUE\_UPDATE\_INTERVAL} and
\MacroNI{STARTER\_UPDATE\_INTERVAL}.

Under Linux, \AdAttr{ProportionalSetSize} is a better indicator of
memory usage for jobs with significant sharing of memory between
processes, because \AdAttr{ImageSize} is simply the sum of virtual
memory sizes across all of the processes in the job, which may count
the same memory pages more than once.

\item[\AdAttr{NumShadowStarts}:]  An integer count of the number of
  times a \Condor{shadow} daemon was started for a given job.
  This attribute is not defined for
  \SubmitCmd{scheduler} universe jobs, since
  they do not have a \Condor{shadow} daemon associated with them.
  For \SubmitCmd{local} universe jobs, this attribute \emph{is}
  defined, even though the process that manages the job is technically
  a \Condor{starter} rather than a \Condor{shadow}.  
  This keeps the management of the
  local universe and other universes as similar as possible.

%%% ClassAd attribute: NumSystemHolds

\index{NumSystemHolds!job ClassAd attribute}
\item[\AdAttr{NumSystemHolds}:]   An integer that is incremented each time
Condor-G places a job on hold due to some sort of error condition.  This
counter is useful, since Condor-G will always place a job on hold when it
gives up on some error condition.  Note that if the user places the job
on hold using the \Condor{hold} command, this attribute is not incremented.

%%% ClassAd attribute: OtherJobRemoveRequirements

\end{verbatim}
This attribute is used for jobs managed with \Condor{dagman} to ensure
that node jobs of the DAG are removed when the \Condor{dagman} job
itself is removed.  Note that the list of jobs defined by this attribute
must not form a cyclic removal of jobs,
or the \Condor{schedd} will go into an infinite loop 
when any of the jobs is removed.

%%% ClassAd attribute: Owner

\index{Owner!job ClassAd attribute}
\item[\AdAttr{Owner}:]  String describing the user who submitted this
job.

%%% ClassAd attribute: ParallelShutdownPolicy
\index{ClassAd job attribute!ParallelShutdownPolicy}
\index{ParallelShutdownPolicy!job ClassAd attribute}
\item[\AdAttr{ParallelShutdownPolicy}:]  A string that is only relevant
to parallel universe jobs.  Without this attribute defined, the default
policy applied to parallel universe jobs is to consider the whole job
completed when the first node exits, killing processes running on
all remaining nodes.  If defined to the following strings, Condor's
behavior changes:
  \begin{description}
  \item[\AdStr{WAIT\_FOR\_ALL}] Condor will wait until every node in 
  the parallel job has completed to consider the job finished.
  \end{description}

Within a cluster of many jobs,
each job has the same \Attr{ClusterId}, but will have a unique \Attr{ProcId}.
Within a cluster, assignment of a \Attr{ProcId} value will start
with the value 0.
The job (process) identifier described here is unrelated to operating
system PIDs.

\index{ProportionalSetSizeKb!job ClassAd attribute}
\item[\AdAttr{ProportionalSetSizeKb}:]
On Linux execute machines with kernel version more recent than 2.6.27,
this is the maximum observed proportional set size (PSS) in Kbytes,
summed across all processes in the job.
If the execute machine does not
support monitoring of PSS or PSS has not yet been measured,
this attribute will be undefined.  
PSS differs from \AdAttr{ImageSize} in how memory shared
between processes is accounted.
The PSS for one process is the sum of that process' memory pages 
divided by the number of processes sharing each of the pages.
\Attr{ImageSize} is the same,
except there is no division by the number of processes sharing the pages.

%%% ClassAd attribute: QDate

This also includes time spent in suspension (if any),
so the total real time spent running is 
\begin{verbatim}
RemoteWallClockTime - CumulativeSuspensionTime
\end{verbatim}
Note that this number does not get reset to
zero when a job is forced to migrate from one machine to another.
\AdAttr{CommittedTime}, on the other hand, is just like
\AdAttr{RemoteWallClockTime} except it does get reset to 0 whenever
the job is evicted without a checkpoint.

%%% ClassAd attribute: RemoveKillSig
\index{ClassAd job attribute!RemoveKillSig}
\index{RemoveKillSig!job ClassAd attribute}
\item[\AdAttr{RemoveKillSig}:]    Currently only for scheduler universe jobs,

\index{StreamErr!job ClassAd attribute}
\item[\AdAttr{StreamErr}:]   
An attribute utilized only for grid universe jobs.
The default value is \Expr{True}.
If \Expr{True}, and \Attr{TransferErr} is \Expr{True}, then 
standard error is streamed back to the submit machine, instead
of doing the transfer (as a whole) after the job completes.
If \Expr{False}, then
standard error is transferred back to the submit machine

\index{ClassAd job attribute!X509UserProxyExpiration}
\index{X509UserProxyExpiration!job ClassAd attribute}
\item[\AdAttr{X509UserProxyExpiration}:]   
For a job that defines the submit description file command
\SubmitCmd{x509userproxy}, this is the time at which the indicated
X.509 proxy credential will expire, measured in the
number of seconds since the epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970).

%%% ClassAd attribute: X509UserProxyEmail

\index{X509UserProxyEmail!job ClassAd attribute}
\item[\AdAttr{X509UserProxyEmail}:]   
\item For a job with an X.509 proxy credential, this is the email
address extracted from the proxy.

%%% ClassAd attribute: X509UserProxyFirstFQAN
\index{ClassAd job attribute!X509UserProxyFirstFQAN}
\index{X509UserProxyFirstFQAN!job ClassAd attribute}
\item[\AdAttr{X509UserProxyFirstFQAN}:]   
For a vanilla or grid universe job that defines the submit description
file command \SubmitCmd{x509userproxy}, 
this is the VOMS Fully Qualified Attribute Name (FQAN) of
the primary role of the credential. 
A credential may have multiple roles defined, 
but by convention the one listed first is the primary role. 

%%% ClassAd attribute: X509UserProxyFQAN
\index{ClassAd job attribute!X509UserProxyFQAN}
\index{X509UserProxyFQAN!job ClassAd attribute}
\item[\AdAttr{X509UserProxyFQAN}:]   
For a vanilla or grid universe job that defines the submit description
file command \SubmitCmd{x509userproxy}, 
this is a serialized list of the DN and all FQAN.
A comma is used as a separator,
and any existing commas in the DN or FQAN are replaced with the string
\Expr{\&comma;}.
Likewise, any ampersands in the DN or FQAN are replaced with
\Expr{\&amp;}.

%%% ClassAd attribute: X509UserProxySubject
\index{ClassAd job attribute!X509UserProxySubject}
\index{X509UserProxySubject!job ClassAd attribute}
\item[\AdAttr{X509UserProxySubject}:]   
For a vanilla or grid universe job that defines the submit description
file command \SubmitCmd{x509userproxy}, 
this attribute contains the Distinguished Name (DN) of the credential
used to submit the job.

%%% ClassAd attribute: X509UserProxyVOName
\index{ClassAd job attribute!X509UserProxyVOName}

\item[\AdAttr{X509UserProxyVOName}:]   
For a vanilla or grid universe job that defines the submit description
file command \SubmitCmd{x509userproxy}, 
this is the name of the VOMS virtual organization (VO) that 
the user's credential is part of. 

%%% ClassAd attribute: DelegateJobGSICredentialsLifetime
\index{ClassAd job attribute!DelegateJobGSICredentialsLifetime}
\index{DelegateJobGSICredentialsLifetime!job ClassAd attribute}
\item[\AdAttr{DelegateJobGSICredentialsLifetime}:]   
An integer that specifies the maximum number of seconds for which
delegated proxies should be valid.  The default behavior is determined
by the configuration
setting \Macro{DELEGATE\_JOB\_GSI\_CREDENTIALS\_LIFETIME}, which
defaults to one day.  A value of 0 indicates that the delegated proxy
should be valid for as long as allowed by the credential used to
create the proxy.  This setting currently only applies to proxies
delegated for non-grid jobs and Condor-C jobs.  It does not currently
apply to globus grid jobs, which always behave as though this setting
were 0.  This setting has no effect if the configuration
setting \Macro{DELEGATE\_JOB\_GSI\_CREDENTIALS} is false, because in
that case the job proxy is copied rather than delegated.
