Contrib modules are stand alone, separate pieces of code that work
together with Condor to accomplish some task.
These modules are available for download at 
\URL{http://research.cs.wisc.edu/condor/downloads-v2}.
Documentation for these modules is either here and identified
as a contrib module, 
or may be within the module itself.

Other features of Condor are available within the source code,
but are not compiled in to the binaries distributed.
To utilize these features, 
acquire the source code and build it.
Enable the feature as described in this documentation.

This chapter documents the CondorView Client contrib module,
Quill (available with the source code),
and using Condor with the Hadoop File System (available with the source code).
