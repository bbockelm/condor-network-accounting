\begin{enumerate}

\index{Unix!fork}
\index{Unix!exec}
\index{Unix!system}
\item Multi-process jobs are not allowed.  This includes system calls such as
\Syscall{fork}, \Syscall{exec}, and \Syscall{system}.

\index{Unix!pipe}
\index{Unix!semaphore}
\index{Unix!shared memory}
\item Interprocess communication is not allowed.  This includes pipes, semaphores, and shared memory.

\index{Unix!socket}
\index{network}
\item Network communication must be brief.  A job \emph{may} make network
connections using system calls such as \Syscall{socket}, but a network
connection left open for long periods will delay checkpointing and migration.

\index{signal}
\index{signal!SIGUSR2}
\index{signal!SIGTSTP}
\item Sending or receiving the SIGUSR2 or SIGTSTP signals is not allowed.
Condor reserves these signals for its own use.  Sending or receiving all
other signals \emph{is} allowed.

\index{Unix!alarm}
\index{Unix!timer}
\index{Unix!sleep}
\item Alarms, timers, and sleeping are not allowed.  This includes system
calls such as \Syscall{alarm}, \Syscall{getitimer}, and \Syscall{sleep}.

\index{thread!kernel-level}
\index{thread!user-level}
\item Multiple kernel-level threads are not allowed.  However,
multiple user-level threads \emph{are} allowed.

\index{file!memory-mapped}
\index{Unix!mmap}
\item Memory mapped files are not allowed.  This includes system calls such
as \Syscall{mmap} and \Syscall{munmap}.

\index{file!locking}
\index{Unix!flock}
\index{Unix!lockf}
\item File locks are allowed, but not retained between checkpoints.

\index{file!read only}
\index{file!write only}
\item All files must be opened read-only or write-only.  A file opened
for both reading and writing will cause trouble if a job must be rolled back
to an old checkpoint image.  For compatibility reasons, a file opened
for both reading and writing will result in a warning but not an error.

\item A fair amount of disk space must be available on the submitting machine
for storing a job's checkpoint images.  A checkpoint image is approximately
equal to the virtual memory consumed by a job while it runs.  If disk space
is short, a special \Term{checkpoint server} can be designated for storing
all the checkpoint images for a pool.

\index{linking!dynamic}
\index{linking!static}
\item On Linux, the job must be statically linked. 
\Condor{compile} does this by default.

\index{Unix!large files} 
\item Reading to or writing from files larger than 2 GBytes is only supported
when the submit side \Condor{shadow} and the standard universe user job
application itself are both 64-bit executables.
