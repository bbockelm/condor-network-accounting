\section{\label{sec:History-7-7}Development Release Series 7.7}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the development release series of Condor.
The details of each version are described below.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-7-7-3}Version 7.7.3}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item Condor version 7.7.3 not yet released.
%\item Condor version 7.7.3 released on Month Date, 2011.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item \Condor{userprio} supports new flags: The -grouporder flag displays submitter 
entries for accounting groups at top of list and in breadth-first order by group 
hierarchy. The -grouprollup flag reports accounting statistics for groups rolled up
by group hierarchy.
\Ticket{1926}

\item \Condor{collector} now avoids performance problems that happened
previously when clients initiated communication with the collector but
then delayed sending input.
\Ticket{2506}

\item When using versions of glexec that create a copy of the proxy for use
by the job, Condor now ensures that this copy of the proxy is cleaned up
when the job is done.
\Ticket{2501}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

\item A new configuration variable \Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_SLOT\_CONSTRAINT} 
can contain an expression which is passed from the Negotiator to the 
Collector when it fetches ClassAds for the negotiation cycle. 
\Ticket{2277}

\item A new configuration variable \Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_SLOT\_POOLSIZE\_CONSTRAINT} 
replaces \Macro{GROUP\_DYNAMIC\_MACH\_CONSTRAINT}, which has been retained as a
alternate name.  The poolsize resulting from applying this constraint is used
to determine quotas for both dynamic groups and when there are no groups.
\Ticket{2277}

\item The configuration variable \Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_STARTD\_CONSTRAINT\_REMOVE} 
was made obsolete by \Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_SLOT\_CONSTRAINT} so it has been removed.
\Ticket{2277}

\item The configuration variables \Macro{IGNORE\_NFS\_LOCK\_ERRORS}
  and \Macro{BIND\_ALL\_INTERFACES} no longer support, undocumented,
  'Y' or 'y' to mean True.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Added logic to the \Condor{negotiator} daemon's Accountant
initialization to ensure that table entries are always created for
accounting groups on startup and reconfig.
\Ticket{2509}

\item When \Condor{advertise} is used with the \Opt{-tcp} option, this
used to cause the following log message to appear in the \Condor{collector}
log:
\begin{verbatim}
DaemonCore: Can't receive command request from IP (perhaps a timeout?)
\end{verbatim}
\Ticket{2483}

\item \MacroNI{NETWORK\_INTERFACE} did not have any effect.  This bug
was introduced in 7.7.0.
\Ticket{2513}

\item Glexec now also works when condor is running as root.
\Ticket{2503}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Additions and Changes to the Manual:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-7-7-2}Version 7.7.2}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item Condor version 7.7.2 not yet released.
%\item Condor version 7.7.2 released on Month Date, 2011.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item There is command line support to both suspend and continue jobs. 
\Ticket{2368}

\item The EC2 GAHP now supports X.509 for connecting to and authenticating
with EC2 services.  See section~\ref{sec:Amazon-submit} for details
on using the X.509 protocol.
\Ticket{2084}

\item Previously, the dedicated scheduler attempted to change the
\Attr{Scheduler} attribute on all parallel job processes in a durable fashion,
resulting in an \Procedure{fsync} for each process.
This has been changed to be not durable, 
thereby improving the scalability by reducing the 
number of \Procedure{fsync} calls without impacting correctness. 
\Ticket{2367}

\item In PrivSep mode, when an error is encountered when trying to
switch to the user account chosen for running the job, 
the error message has been improved to make debugging easier.  
Now, the error message distinguishes between safety check failures 
for the UID, tracking group ID, primary group ID, and supplementary group IDs.
\Ticket{2364}

\item When using \Prog{glexec}, if there is a conflict between
environment specified for the job and environment inherited from \Prog{glexec},
the environment always takes precedence when running the job.
Previously, the environment inherited from \Prog{glexec} took precedence.
\Ticket{2096}

\item The name of the user used to execute the job is now logged in
the \Condor{starter} log, except when using \Prog{glexec}.
\Ticket{2268}

\item \Condor{dagman} now defaults to writing a partial DAG file
for a Rescue DAG,
as opposed to a full DAG file.
The Rescue DAG file is parsed in combination with the original DAG file, 
meaning that any
changes to the original DAG input file take effect when running a Rescue DAG.
\Ticket{2165}

\item The behavior of DAGMan is changed, such that, by default, 
POST scripts will be run regardless of the return value from 
the PRE script of the same node as described in section~\ref{dagman:SCRIPT}.  
The previous behavior of not running the POST script can be restored by
either adding the \Opt{-AlwaysRunPost} option to the \Condor{submit\_dag}
command line, 
or by setting the new configuration variable
\Macro{DAGMAN\_ALWAYS\_RUN\_POST} to \Expr{False}, 
as defined at~\ref{param:DAGmanAlwaysRunPost}.
\Ticket{2057}

% moved to 7.7.2 
% gittrac #659 
%\item Filip Krikava supplied a patch that limits the number of 
%file descriptors that DAGMan has open at a time.
%The reason for creating this capability is that
%DAGman tends to fail on wide DAGs, where many jobs are independent,
%rather than being linear, where jobs have many dependencies.

\item A matchmaking optimization has significantly improved the speed 
of matching,
when there are machines with many slots.
\Ticket{2403}

\item When the \Condor{schedd} is starting up and it encounters corruption
in its job transaction log, the error message in the log file now reports
the offset within the file at which the error occurred.
\Ticket{2450}

% gittrac #2167
\item DAGMan will now copy PRIORITY values from the DAG input file to 
the \Attr{JobPrio} attribute in the job ClassAd.  
Furthermore, the PRIORITY values are propagated to child nodes and SUBDAGs, 
so that child nodes always have priority at least that
of the maximum of the priorities of its parents.  
This has been a cause of confusion for DAGMan users.
\Ticket{2167}

\item The \Condor{startd} now logs a clear message if it rejects a job
because no valid starters were detected.
\Ticket{2470}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

\item The new job ClassAd attribute \Attr{PreserveRelativeExecutable}, 
when set to \Expr{True}, will prevent the \Condor{starter} from 
prepending \Attr{Iwd} to the command executable \Attr{Cmd}, when
when \Attr{Cmd} is a relative path name and \Attr{TransferExecutable} 
is \Expr{False}.
\Ticket{2460}

\item Attributes have been added to all daemons to publish statistics 
about the the number of timers, signals, socket, and pipe messages 
that have been handled, as well as the amount of time spent handling them.	Statistics attributes for DaemonCore
have names that begin with \Expr{DC} or \Expr{RecentDC}.
\Ticket{2354}

\item The default value of \Attr{OpSys} on Windows machines has been changed
to \AdStr{WINDOWS}, and a new attribute \Attr{OpSysVer} has been added 
that contains the version number of the operating system.  
This behavior is controlled by a new configuration variable
\Macro{ENABLE\_VERSIONED\_OPSYS} which defaults to \Expr{False} on Windows 
and to \Expr{True} on other platforms.  
The new machine ClassAd attribute \Attr{OpSys\_And\_Ver} will always contain 
the versioned operating system.  
Note that this change could cause problems with mixed pools,
because Condor version 7.7.2 \Condor{submit} may add \Expr{OpSys="WINDOWS"}, 
but machines running Condor versions prior to 7.7.2 will be publishing 
a versioned \Attr{OpSys} value,
unless there is an override in the configuration.
\Ticket{2366}

\item Configuration variable \Macro{COLLECTOR\_ADDRESS\_FILE} is now set 
in the example configuration,
similar to \MacroNI{MASTER\_ADDRESS\_FILE}.
This configuration variable is required when \Macro{COLLECTOR\_HOST} 
has the port set to 0, which means to select any available port.
In other environments, it should have no visible impact.
\Ticket{2375}

% gittrac #2197
\item Attributes have been added to the \Condor{schedd} 
to publish aggregate statistics
about jobs that are running and have completed, as well as counts of various
failures. See section ??? for details.
\Ticket{2197}

\item The new configuration variable \Macro{DAGMAN\_WRITE\_PARTIAL\_RESCUE}
enables the new feature of writing a partial DAG file, instead of a full
DAG input file, as a Rescue DAG.  
See section~\ref{param:DAGManWritePartialRescue} for a definition.
Also, the configuration variable
\Macro{DAGMAN\_OLD\_RESCUE} no longer exists,
as it is incompatible with the implementation of partial Rescue DAGs.
\Ticket{2165}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

% gittrac #2467
\item Fixed a bug introduced in 7.7.1 in the standard universe where
the \Syscall{getdirentries} call failed during remote I/O situations.

\item Fixed a bug in the \Condor{startd} that was preventing dynamic slots
from being properly instantiated from partitionable slots.
\Ticket{2507}

\item Fixed a bug introduced in Condor version 7.7.0, 
in which the \Condor{startd} may erroneously report 
\Expr{Can't find hostname of client machine.}
In cases where Condor was unable to identify the host name, 
the \Attr{ClientMachine}
attribute in the machine ClassAd would have gone unset.
\Ticket{2382}

\item Fixed a bug existing since April 2001,
in which on \Condor{schedd} startup, with parallel universe jobs, 
the job queue sanity checking code would change the \Attr{Scheduler}
attribute on jobs,
only to have the attribute changed later by the dedicated scheduler.
\Ticket{2367}

\item Offline ads with neither \Attr{MyType} nor \Attr{TargetType} 
attributes defined caused
the \Condor{collector} to fail to start when it was next restarted.
\Ticket{2417}

\item Fixed a file descriptor leak in the EC2 GAHP,
 which would cause grid-type ec2 jobs to become held. 
The \Attr{HoldReason} for most such jobs would be 
\Expr{Unable to read from accesskey file.}
\Ticket{2447}

\item Fixed a bug that could cause a job's standard output and error to
be written to the wrong location when \SubmitCmd{should\_transfer\_files} was
set to \Expr{IF\_NEEDED},
and the job runs on the machine where file transfer is not needed.
If the standard output or error file names contained any path information,
the output would be written to \File{\_condor\_stdout} or
\File{\_condor\_stderr} in the job's initial working directory.
\Ticket{1811}

\item Fixed a bug that could cause the \Condor{schedd} to crash after
failing to expand a \verb@$$@ macro in the job ad.  This problem was
introduced in 7.7.1.
\Ticket{2491}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Additions and Changes to the Manual:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-7-7-1}Version 7.7.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

%\item Condor version 7.7.1 not yet released.
\item Condor version 7.7.1 released on September 12, 2011.
This developer release contains all bug fixes from Condor version 7.6.3.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item
\emph{Condor now dynamically links with the OpenSSL and Kerberos security
libraries, and Condor will use the operating system's version of these
libraries,  when they are available.} 
The tarball release of Condor on Linux platforms includes 
a copy of these libraries.  
If the operating system's version is incompatible with Condor, 
Condor will use its own copy instead.
Condor's copy of these libraries is located under \File{lib/condor/}.
To prevent Condor from considering using them, delete these libraries.
\Ticket{1874}

\item 
The ClassAd language now has an \Procedure{unparse} function.  
It converts an expression into a string, 
which is handy with the new \Procedure{eval} function.
\Ticket{1613}

\item
The new job ClassAd attribute \Attr{KeepClaimIdle} is defined with an integer
number of seconds in the job submit description file, as the example:
\begin{verbatim}
  +KeepClaimIdle = 300
\end{verbatim}
If set, then when the job exits, 
if there are no other jobs immediately ready to run for this user, 
the \Condor{schedd} daemon,
instead of relinquishing the claim back to the \Condor{negotiator}, 
will keep the claim for the specified number of seconds.  
This is useful if another job will be arriving soon, 
which can happen with linear DAGs.  
The \Condor{startd} slot
will go to the Claimed Idle state for at least that many seconds until
either a new job arrives or the timeout occurs.
See page~\pageref{sec:Job-ClassAd-Attributes},
the unnumbered Appendix A for a complete definition of this
job ClassAd attribute.
\Ticket{2094}

% gittrac #2122
\item The new \Arg{PRE\_SKIP} key word in DAGMan changes the
behavior of DAG node execution such that the node's job and POST script
may be skipped based on the exit value of the PRE script.
See section ~\ref{dagman:SCRIPT} for details.
\Ticket{2122}

% uncomment item, if it appears in 7.7.1
% gittrac #659 
%\item Filip Krikava supplied a patch that limits the number of 
%file descriptors that DAGMan has open at a time.
%The reason for creating this capability is that
%DAGman tends to fail on wide DAGs, where many jobs are independent,
%rather than being linear, where jobs have many dependencies.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

\item The new configuration variable 
\Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_STARTD\_CONSTRAINT\_REMOVE} defaults to \Expr{False}.
When \Expr{True}, any ClassAds not satisfying the expression 
in \MacroNI{GROUP\_DYNAMIC\_MACH\_CONSTRAINT} are removed from the
list of \Condor{startd} ClassAds considered for negotiation.
\Ticket{2232}

\item The new configuration variable
\Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_UPDATE\_AFTER\_CYCLE} defaults to \Expr{False}.
When \Expr{True}, it forces the \Condor{negotiator} daemon
to update the negotiator ClassAd in the \Condor{collector} daemon
at the end of every negotiation cycle.  
This is handy for monitoring and debugging activities.
\Ticket{2373}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Expressions for periodic policies such as 
\MacroNI{PERIODIC\_HOLD} and \MacroNI{PERIODIC\_RELEASE} 
could inadvertently cause a claim to be released,
 if the \Condor{shadow} exited before waiting for final update from the 
\Condor{starter}. 
\Ticket{2329}

\item \Condor{submit} previously could incorrectly detect references
in the requirements expression to special attributes such as
\Attr{Memory} when the name of the attribute happened to appear in a
string literal or as part of the name of some other attribute.  
The detection of references to various special attributes influences the
automatic requirements which are appended to the job requirements.
\Ticket{2350}

\item In rare cases, CCB requests could cause the server to hang for
20 seconds while waiting for all of the request to arrive.
\Ticket{2360}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Additions and Changes to the Manual:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-7-7-0}Version 7.7.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item Condor version 7.7.0 released on July 29, 2011.
This developer release contains all bug fixes from Condor version 7.6.2.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item A full port of Condor is available for RedHat Enterprise Linux 6
on the x86\_64 processor.
A full port includes support for the standard universe.

\item The matchmaking attributes \Attr{SubmitterUserResourcesInUse}
and \Attr{RemoteUserResourcesInUse} are now biased by slot weights.

% gittrac #1971
\item \Condor{submit} now accepts the new command line option \Opt{-addr},
naming the IP address of the \Condor{schedd} to submit to.

\item The \Condor{vm\_gahp} now is dynamically linked to libvirt.  
We believe this makes it more portable.

\item Programs \Condor{reconfig\_schedd} and \Condor{master\_off}
are no longer part of the distribution.
These programs were replaced many years ago by the more general
\Condor{reconfig} and \Condor{off} commands.

\item On Windows platforms, improved the ability of the \Condor{starter}
and \Condor{shadow} daemons to clean up the execute directory,
if jobs have changed the ACLs or permissions on files they have created.

\item \Condor{submit} now sets a default value for job ClassAd attribute
\Attr{RequestMemory}.

\item The submission performance of cream grid jobs has been substantially
improved by batching submit requests.

\item \Condor{q} \Opt{-better} now has cleaner output, and informs
the user when negotiation has not yet occurred.

\item Implemented many improvements to the Condor \Prog{init} scripts.

\item Deltacloud support has been updated to deltacloud version 0.8.

% gittrac #1960
\item As of Condor version 7.6.0,
vm universe submit description files no longer support
automatic creation of cdrom images from text input file.
Users must now explicitly create ISO images and transfer them
with the job.

\item \Condor{q} now supports the new option \Opt{-stream-results}.
  When this option is specified, \Condor{q} displays results as they
  are fetched from the job queue, rather than buffering up the query
  results before displaying anything.

% gittrac #1871 
% gittrac #2295
\item The new submit description file command \SubmitCmd{stack\_size} 
  applies to Linux jobs that are not running in the standard universe. 
  It sets the allocation of stack space to be other than the default
  value, which is unlimited.
  It also advertises the job ClassAd attribute \AdAttr{StackSize}.

% gittrac #1550
\item The new ClassAd function \Code{stringListsIntersect} evaluates to 
  \Expr{True} if two strings of delimited elements have any matching elements,
  and it evaluates to \Expr{False} otherwise.

% gittrac #1821
\item The grid universe now supports the \SubmitCmd{ec2} resource type,
  which uses the EC2 Query (REST) API to start virtual machines on cloud
  resources.

% gittrac #2090 
\item The behavior of DAGMan has changed, 
such that if multiple definitions of a VARS macroname 
for a specific node within a DAG input exist,
a warning is written to the log, of the format
\begin{verbatim}
Warning: VAR <macroname> is already defined in job <JobName>
Discovered at file "<DAG input file name>", line <line number>
\end{verbatim}
See section ~\ref{dagman:VARS} for details.

% gittrac #2297
\item The version number for ClassAds now matches the Condor version number. 

% gittrac #2259
\item When \Prog{glexec} fails to execute a job,
diagnostic error messages produced by \Prog{glexec} used to be discarded.
These error messages are now displayed in the log of the \Condor{starter} 
and in the job's hold reason. 

% gittrac #2185
\item New submit description file commands
\SubmitCmd{periodic\_hold\_reason}, \SubmitCmd{periodic\_hold\_subcode},
\SubmitCmd{on\_exit\_hold\_reason}, and \SubmitCmd{on\_exit\_hold\_subcode}
permit the job to set a hold reason string and subcode number.
Similarly, the system job policy can specify the reason and subcode 
using \Macro{SYSTEM\_PERIODIC\_HOLD\_REASON} and 
\Macro{SYSTEM\_PERIODIC\_HOLD\_SUBCODE}.
In addition, the \Condor{hold} command now accepts a \Opt{-subcode} option,
which is used to set the job attribute \Attr{HoldReasonSubCode}. 

\item If the \Condor{shadow} cannot write to the user log, 
the job is now put on hold.

\end{itemize}


\noindent Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

\item The new configuration variable \Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_UPDATE\_AFTER\_CYCLE}
defaults to \Expr{False}.
If set to \Expr{True}, it will force the \Condor{negotiator} daemon
to publish an update ClassAd to the \Condor{collector} at the end of 
every negotiation cycle. 
This is useful if monitoring cycle-based statistics.

% gittrac #1960
% gittrac #2004
\item The new configuration variable \Macro{SHADOW\_RUN\_UNKNOWN\_USER\_JOBS}
defaults to \Expr{False}.
When \Expr{True}, it allows the \Condor{shadow} daemon to run jobs remotely 
submitted from users not in the local password file.

\item The configuration variables for security 
\Macro{DENY\_CLIENT} and \Macro{HOSTDENY\_CLIENT}
now also look for the prefixes \Expr{TOOL} and \Expr{SUBMIT}.
 
% gittrac #1249
\item \Macro{CONDOR\_VIEW\_HOST} is now a comma and/or white space separated
list of hosts, in order to support more than one CondorView host.

\item For a job with an X.509 proxy credential, the new job ClassAd
attribute \AdAttr{X509UserProxyEmail} is the email address extracted
from the proxy.

% gittrac 2067
\item On Linux execute machines with kernel version more recent than 2.6.27,
the proportional set size (PSS) in Kbytes summed across all
processes in the job is now reported in the attribute
\AdAttr{ProportionalSetSizeKb}.  If the execute machine does not
support monitoring of PSS or PSS has not yet been measured, this
attribute will be undefined.  PSS differs from \AdAttr{ImageSize} in
how memory shared between processes is accounted.  The PSS for one
process is the sum of that process' memory pages divided by the
number of processes sharing each of the pages.  \AdAttr{ImageSize} is
the same, except there is no division by the number of processes
sharing the pages.

% gittrac #1755
\item The new configuration variable \Macro{DAGMAN\_USE\_STRICT} 
turns warnings into errors, as defined in section~\ref{param:DAGManUseStrict}.

% gittrac #2006
\item The \Condor{schedd} now publishes performance-related statistics.
  Page~\pageref{sec:Scheduler-ClassAd-Attributes} in Appendix A contains
  definitions for these new attributes:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \Attr{DetectedMemory}
    \item \Attr{DetectedCpus}
    \item \Attr{UpdateInterval}
    \item \Attr{WindowedStatWidth}
    \item \Attr{ExitCode<N>}
    \item \Attr{ExitCodeCumulative<N>}
    \item \Attr{JobsSubmitted}
    \item \Attr{JobsSubmittedCumulative}
    \item \Attr{JobsStarted}
    \item \Attr{JobsStartedCumulative}
    \item \Attr{JobsCompleted}
    \item \Attr{JobsCompletedCumulative}
    \item \Attr{JobsExited}
    \item \Attr{JobsExitedCumulative}
    \item \Attr{ShadowExceptions}
    \item \Attr{ShadowExceptionsCumulative}
    \item \Attr{JobSubmissionRate}
    \item \Attr{JobStartRate}
    \item \Attr{JobCompletionRate}
    \item \Attr{MeanTimeToStart}
    \item \Attr{MeanTimeToStartCumulative}
    \item \Attr{MeanRunningTime}
    \item \Attr{MeanRunningTimeCumulative}
    \item \Attr{SumTimeToStartCumulative}
    \item \Attr{SumRunningTimeCumulative}
  \end{itemize}

% gittrac #1930
\item For Windows platforms, the \Condor{startd} now publishes the 
ClassAd attribute \Attr{DotNetVersions},
containing a comma separated list of installed .NET versions.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug in which the \Condor{startd} daemon can get stuck in a
loop trying to execute an invalid, 
that is non-existent, Daemon ClassAd Hook job.

\item Fixed bug that would cause the \Condor{startd} daemon to incorrectly
report Benchmarking activity instead of Idle activity,
when there is a problem launching the benchmarking programs.

\item On Windows only, fixed a rare bug that could cause
a sporadic access violation when a Condor daemon spawned another process.

\item Fixed a bug introduced in Condor version 7.5.5,
which caused the \Condor{schedd} to die managing parallel jobs.

% commented out, as this bug fix is listed in the 7.6.1 version history.
% \item Fixed bug present throughout ClassAds,
% where expressions expecting a floating point value returned an error,
% if they got a boolean value.  This is common in \MacroNI{RANK} expressions.

\item The \Condor{startd} daemon now looks up the \Condor{kbdd} daemon address
on every update.  
This fixed problems if the \Condor{kbdd} daemon is restarted 
during the \Condor{startd} lifespan.

\item Fixed bug in \Condor{hold} that happened if the hold
reason contained a double quote character.

\item Fixed a bug introduced in Condor version 7.5.6 that
caused any Daemon ClassAd hook job with non-empty value for
\MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_<JobName>\_ARGS},
\MacroNI{SCHEDD\_CRON\_<JobName>\_ARGS}
or \MacroNI{BENCHMARKS\_<JobName>\_ARGS} to fail.
Also, the specification of 
\MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_<JobName>\_ENV},
\MacroNI{SCHEDD\_CRON\_<JobName>\_ENV},
or \MacroNI{BENCHMARKS\_<JobName>\_ENV} for these jobs was ignored.

\item Fixed bug in the RPM \Prog{init} script. 
A status request would always report Condor as inactive, 
and a shutdown request would not report failure if there was a
timeout shutting down Condor.

\item File transfer plug-ins now have a correctly set environment.

\item Fixed a problem with detecting IBM Java Virtual Machines whose
version strings have embedded newline characters.

\item \Condor{q} \Opt{-analyze} now works with ClassAd built-in functions.

\item Fixed bug in \Condor{q} \Opt{-run}, such that it displays
the host name correctly for local and scheduler universe jobs.

\item Standalone checkpointing now works with compressed checkpoints again.
This had been broken in Condor version 7.5.4.

%gittrac 1962
\item On Windows, \Prog{net stop condor} would sometimes cause the
\Condor{master} daemon to crash.  This is now fixed.

% gittrac #1928
\item \AdAttr{JobUniverse} was effectively a required attribute for
  jobs created via the Fetch Work hook,
  due to the need to set the \MacroNI{IS\_VALID\_CHECKPOINT\_PLATFORM}
  expression, such that it would not evaluate to \Expr{Undefined}.
  Now the default \MacroNI{IS\_VALID\_CHECKPOINT\_PLATFORM} expression
  evaluates to \Expr{True} when \AdAttr{JobUniverse} is not defined.

% gittrac #1943
\item When there are multiple cpus but only one slot, the slot name no
longer begins with \Expr{slot1@}.

% gittrac #1805
