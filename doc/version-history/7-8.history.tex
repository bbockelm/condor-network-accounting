\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item When ClassAd function stringListMember() is called with an empty
string as the second argument, it now evaluates to \Expr{False}.
Previously, it incorrectly evaluated to \Expr{Undefined}.
\Ticket{2953}

\item Format tags \%v and \%V for the \Opt{-format} option now properly
print all ClassAd value types. Previously, \Expr{True} and \Expr{False}
were printed as integers, and new ClassAd types like lists and nested
ads couldn't be printed.
\Ticket{2960}

\Opt{ident} program on unix. They were missing in Condor versions 7.7.3
