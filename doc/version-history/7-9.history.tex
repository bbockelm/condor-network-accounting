%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-7-9-0}Version 7.9.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item Condor version 7.9.0 not yet released.
%\item Condor version 7.9.0 released on Month Date, 2012.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Added logging output flag \Dflag{LEVEL} which causes Condor to include the logging level
flags in effect for each line of logging output.
\Ticket{2712}

\item Added -autoformat option to \Condor{status}, behavior is the same as -autoformat option
added to \Condor{q} in 7.7.6.
\Ticket{2941}

\item Enhanced the classad log system (e.g. the job que log) to report the record number on parse failures, 
and improved its ability to detect parse failures closer to the point of corruption.
\Ticket{2934}

\item Added an \Opt{-evaluate} option to \Condor{config\_val}, which causes the configured value queried from
a given daemon to be evaluated with respect to that daemon's ClassAd.
\Ticket{856}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

\item New configuration variables were added to to the \Condor{schedd} to
define statistics that count subsets of jobs. These variables
have the form \Macro{SCHEDD\_COLLECT\_STATS\_BY\_XXXX} and should contain
a ClassAd expression that evaluates to a string.
XXXX\_value\_ will be prefixed to the names of attributes in the \Condor{schedd} ad
such as \Attr{XXXX\_string\_JobsStarted} which would be the count of jobs that have
started that evaluate to "value".  An optional variable of the form
\Macro{SCHEDD\_EXPIRE\_STATS\_BY\_XXXX} can be used to set an expiration time in seconds
for each set of statistics.
\Ticket{2862}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Condor will avoid selecting down (disabled) network interfaces.  Previously Condor could select a down interface over an up (active) interface.
\Ticket{2893}

\item Made \Condor{negotiator} logic for computing submitter limits properly aware of \Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_CONSIDER\_PREEMPTION}.
\Ticket{2952}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.
