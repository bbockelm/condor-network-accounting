The popular Grid Engine batch system (formerly known as Sun Grid Engine and
abbreviated SGE) is available in two varieties:
Oracle Grid Engine
(\URL{http://http://www.oracle.com/us/products/tools/oracle-grid-engine-075549.html})
and Univa Grid Engine
(\URL{http://www.univa.com/?gclid=CLXg6-OEy6wCFWICQAodl0lm9Q}).

Condor jobs are submitted to a local SGE system
using the \SubmitCmd{grid} universe and adding the
\SubmitCmd{grid\_resource} command by placing
into the submit description file:
\begin{verbatim}
grid_resource = sge
\end{verbatim}

The sge grid type requires two variables to be set in the Condor
configuration file.
\Macro{SGE\_GAHP} is the path to the SGE GAHP server binary that is to be
used to submit SGE jobs.
\Macro{GLITE\_LOCATION} specifies the path to the directory containing the 
SGE GAHP's configuration file and auxiliary binaries.
In the Condor distribution, this configuration and the auxiliary binaries
are located in the directory \File{\MacroUNI{LIB}/glite/}.
The SGE GAHP's configuration file will be at
\File{\MacroUNI{GLITE\_LOCATION}/etc/batch\_gahp.config}.
The SGE GAHP's auxiliary binaries
are in the directory \File{\MacroUNI{GLITE\_LOCATION}/bin/}.
The Condor configuration file appears

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
GLITE_LOCATION = $(LIB)/glite
SGE_GAHP       = $(GLITE_LOCATION)/bin/batch_gahp
\end{verbatim}
