% 2 hyphens in a row, without any spaces inbetween poses a problem
% for LaTeX.  Things tried, without success.
%   --      results in a single hyphen
%   - -     results in a 2 hyphens, with too much space inbetween
%   -\--    results in a 2 hyphens, with too much space inbetween
%  $--$     results in 2 long, very high up dashes, with nice spacing
%  $-$$-$   results in 2 long, very high up dashes, with too much spacing

% Alain's fix
%   {\tt--}          makes one nice dash in html
%                    makes 2 nice dashes in postscript
%   {\tt--}{\tt--}   makes 2 nice dashes that collide with following letter
%                       in html
%                    makes 4  nice dashes in postscript
%   {\small{\tt--}}{\small{\tt--}}  2 nice dashes in html
%                                   4 nice dashes in postscript

% Peter's fix
%   ---            makes 2 dashes exactly as required in the html
%                  makes 1 very long dash in postscript

% Karen's final fix:  do everything manually (no LaTeX macros),
%  and use the verbatim.

\Description 

\Condor{configure} and \Condor{install} refer to a single script that installs
and/or configures Condor on Unix machines.  As the names imply,
\Condor{install} is intended to perform a Condor installation, and
\Condor{configure} is intended to configure (or reconfigure) an
existing installation.
Both will run with Perl 5.6.0 or more recent versions.

\Condor{configure} (and \Condor{install}) are designed to be run more
than one time where required.
It can install Condor when invoked with a correct configuration via
\begin{verbatim}
condor_install
\end{verbatim}
or 
\begin{verbatim}
condor_configure --install
\end{verbatim}
or, it can change the configuration files when invoked via
\begin{verbatim}
condor_configure
\end{verbatim}
Note that changes in the configuration files do not result
in changes while Condor is running.
To effect changes while Condor is running,
it is necessary to further use the \Condor{reconfig} or \Condor{restart}
command.
\Condor{reconfig}  is required where the currently executing
daemons need to be informed of configuration changes.
\Condor{restart} is required where the options
\verb@--@\textbf{make-personal-condor} or
\verb@--@\textbf{type}
are used, since these affect which daemons are running.

Running \Condor{configure} or \Condor{install} with no options results
in a usage screen being printed.
The \verb@--@\textbf{help} option can be used to display a full help screen.

Within the options given below, 
the phrase \Term{release directories} is the list of directories that are
released with Condor.  This list includes: 
\File{bin}, \File{etc}, \File{examples}, \File{include},
\File{lib}, \File{libexec}, \File{man}, \File{sbin},
\File{sql} and \File{src}.

\begin{Options}
  \OptItem{\Opt{---help}} {Print help screen and exit}

  \OptItem{\Opt{---install}} {Perform installation, assuming that
    the current working directory contains the release directories.
    Without further options, the configuration is that of
    a Personal Condor, a complete one-machine pool.
    If used as an 
    upgrade within an existing installation directory, existing 
    configuration files and local directory are preserved.  This
    is the default behavior of \Condor{install}. }

  \OptItem{\Opt{---install-dir=$<$path$>$}} {Specifies the path
    where Condor should be installed or the path where it already is
    installed. The default is the current working directory.}

  \OptItem{\Opt{---prefix=$<$path$>$}} {This is an alias for
    \Opt{--install-dir}.}

  \OptItem{\Opt{---local-dir=$<$path$>$}} {Specifies the
    location of the local directory, which is the directory that generally 
    contains the local (machine-specific) configuration file as well as the
    directories where Condor daemons write their run-time information 
    (\File{spool}, \File{log}, \File{execute}).
    This location is indicated  by the \MacroNI{LOCAL\_DIR} 
    variable in the configuration file. 
    When installing (that is, if \Opt{--install} is specified),
    \Condor{configure} 
    will properly create the local directory in the location specified.
    If none is specified, the default value is given by the evaluation of
    \File{\$(RELEASE\_DIR)/local.\$(HOSTNAME)}.

    During subsequent invocations of \Condor{configure}
    (that is, without the ---install option),
    if the ---local-dir option is specified, the new directory
    will be created and the \File{log}, \File{spool} and \File{execute} 
    directories will be moved there from their current location.}

  \OptItem{\Opt{---make-personal-condor}} {Installs and configures for 
     Personal Condor, a fully-functional, one-machine pool.}

  \OptItem{\Opt{---type= $<$ submit, execute, manager $>$}} {One
    or more of the types may be listed.
    This determines the roles that a machine may play in a pool.
    In general, any machine can be a submit and/or execute machine,
    and there is one central manager per pool.
    In the case of a Personal Condor,
    the machine fulfills all three of these roles.}

  \OptItem {\Opt{---central-manager=$<$hostname$>$}} {Instructs
    the current Condor installation to use the specified machine
    as the central manager. 
    This modifies the configuration variable \MacroNI{COLLECTOR\_HOST}
    to point to the given host name).
    The central manager machine's Condor configuration needs
    to be independently configured to 
    act as a manager using the option \Opt{--type=manager}. }

  \OptItem{\Opt{---owner=$<$ownername$>$}} {Set configuration
    such that Condor daemons will be executed as the given owner.
    This modifies the 
    ownership on the \File{log}, \File{spool} and \File{execute}
    directories and sets the \MacroNI{CONDOR\_IDS} value
    in the configuration file,
    to ensure that Condor daemons start up as the specified effective user.
    See section~\ref{sec:uids} on
    UIDs in Condor on page~\pageref{sec:uids} for details.
    This is only applicable when \Condor{configure} is run by root.
    If not run as root, the owner is the user running
    the \Condor{configure} command.  }

  \OptItem{\Opt{--overwrite}} {
    Always overwrite the contents of the \File{sbin} directory in
    the installation directory.  By default, \Condor{install}
    will not install if it finds an existing \File{sbin} directory
    with Condor programs in it.  In this case, \Condor{install}
    will exit with an error message.  Specify
    \Opt{--overwrite} or \Opt{--backup} to tell \Condor{install}
    what to do.

    This prevents \Condor{install} from moving an \File{sbin}
    directory out of the way that it should not move.  This is
    particularly useful when trying to install Condor in a
    location used by other things (\File{/usr}, \File{/usr/local}, etc.)
    For example: \Condor{install} \Opt{--prefix=/usr}
         will not move
    \File{/usr/sbin} out of the way unless you specify the
    \Opt{--backup} option.

    The \Opt{--backup} behavior is used to
    prevent \Condor{install} from overwriting running daemons --
    Unix semantics will keep the existing binaries running, even
    if they have been moved to a new directory.}

  \OptItem{\Opt{---backup}} {
    Always backup the \File{sbin} directory in the installation
    directory.  By default, \Condor{install} will not install if
    it finds an existing \File{sbin} directory with Condor programs
    in it.  In this case, \Condor{install} with exit with an
    error message.  You must specify \Opt{--overwrite} or
    \Opt{--backup} to tell \Condor{install} what to do.

    This prevents \Condor{install} from moving an \File{sbin}
    directory out of the way that it should not move.  This is
    particularly useful if you're trying to install Condor in a
    location used by other things (\File{/usr}, \File{/usr/local}, etc.)
    For example: \Condor{install} \Opt{--prefix=/usr}
         will not move
    \File{/usr/sbin} out of the way unless you specify the
    \Opt{--backup} option.

    The \Opt{--backup} behavior is used to
    prevent \Condor{install} from overwriting running daemons --
    Unix semantics will keep the existing binaries running, even
    if they have been moved to a new directory.}

  \OptItem{\Opt{---ignore-missing-libs}} {
    Ignore missing shared libraries that are detected by
    \Condor{install}.  By default, \Condor{install} will detect
    missing shared libraries such as \File{libstdc++.so.5} on
    Linux; it will print messages and exit if missing libraries
    are detected.  The \Opt{---ignore-missing-libs} will cause
    \Condor{install} to not exit, and to proceed with the
    installation if missing libraries are detected.  }

  \OptItem{\Opt{---force}} {
    This is equivalent to enabling both the \Opt{---overwrite} and
    \Opt{---ignore-missing-libs} command line options.  }

  \OptItem{\Opt{---no-env-scripts}} {
    By default, \Condor{configure} writes simple sh and csh
    shell scripts which can be sourced by their respective
    shells to set the user's \Env{PATH} and \Env{CONDOR\_CONFIG}
    environment
    variables.  This option prevents \Condor{configure} from
    generating these scripts.  }

  \OptItem{\Opt{---env-scripts-dir=$<$directory$>$}} {
    By default, the simple \Prog{sh} and \Prog{csh} shell scripts (see
    \Opt{---no-env-scripts} for details) are created in 
    the root directory of the Condor installation.  This option
    causes \Condor{configure} to generate these scripts in the
    specified directory.  }

  \OptItem{\Opt{---make-personal-stork}} {Creates a 
    Personal Stork, using the \Condor{credd} daemon.}

  \OptItem{\Opt{---stork}} {Configures the 
    Stork data placement server.
    Use this option with the \Opt{---credd} option.}

  \OptItem{\Opt{---credd}} {Configure the
    the \Condor{credd} daemon (credential manager daemon).}

  \OptItem{\Opt{---verbose}} {Print information about changes
    to configuration variables as they occur.}
\end{Options}

\ExitStatus

\Condor{configure} will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success,
and it will exit with a nonzero value upon failure.

\Examples
Install Condor on the machine (machine1@cs.wisc.edu)
to be the pool's central manager.
On machine1,
within the directory that contains the unzipped Condor
distribution directories:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
% condor_install --type=submit,execute,manager
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
This will allow the machine to submit and execute Condor jobs, 
in addition to being the central manager of the pool.


To change the configuration such that
machine2@cs.wisc.edu is an execute-only machine
(that is, a dedicated computing node)
within a pool with central manager on machine1@cs.wisc.edu,
issue the command on that machine2@cs.wisc.edu
from within the directory where Condor is installed:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
% condor_configure --central-manager=machine1@cs.wisc.edu --type=execute
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize



To change the location of the \MacroNI{LOCAL\_DIR} directory
in the configuration file, do (from the directory where Condor is installed):
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
% condor_configure --local-dir=/path/to/new/local/directory
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
This will move the \File{log},\File{spool},\File{execute} directories
to \File{/path/to/new/local/directory} from the current local directory.
