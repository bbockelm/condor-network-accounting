<P>
<I>condor_submit</I> is the program for submitting jobs to Condor.
<I>condor_submit</I> requires a submit-description file which contains commands
to direct the queuing of jobs. One description file may contain
specifications for the queuing of many condor jobs at once. All jobs queued by a
single invocation of <I>condor_submit</I> must share the same executable, and
are referred to as a ``job cluster''. It is advantageous to submit
multiple jobs as a single cluster because:
<UL>
<LI>Only one copy of the checkpoint file is needed to 
represent all jobs in a cluster until they begin execution.
<LI>There is much less overhead involved for Condor to start the next
job in a cluster than for Condor to start a new cluster.  This can make
a big difference if you are submitting lots of short running jobs.
