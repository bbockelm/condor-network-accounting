# Q: Why are we using a checkout of the coredumper head from 05/24/2001 at r31?
#
# A: The latest release at the time of this check in, 1.2.1, doesn't have
# support for building on RHEL 6. This version of the coredumper has the
# fixes necessary for compilation on RHEL 6 and it exists before the next
# official release of Coredumper.
