/**
 * @defgroup globus_ftp_client_restart_plugin Restart Plugin
 * @ingroup globus_ftp_client_plugins
 *
 * The restart plugin implements one scheme for providing reliability
 * functionality for the FTP Client library. Other plugins may be developed
 * to provide other methods of reliability.
 *
 * The specific functionality of this plugin is
 * to restart any FTP operation when a fault occurs. The plugin's operation
 * is parameterized to control how often and when to attempt to restart
 * the operation.
 *
 * This restart plugin will restart an FTP operation if a noticable
 * fault has occurred---a connection timing out, a failure by the server
 * to process a command, a protocol error, an authentication error.
 *
 * This plugin has three user-configurable parameters; these are
 * the maximum number of retries to attempt, the interval to wait between
 * retries, and the deadline after which no further retries will be attempted.
 * These are set by initializing a restart plugin instance with the function
 * globus_ftp_client_restart_plugin_init().
 *
 * <h2>Example Usage</h2>
 *
 * The following example illustrates a typical use of the restart plugin.
 * In this case, we configure a plugin instance to restart the operation
 * for up to an hour, using an exponential back-off between retries.
