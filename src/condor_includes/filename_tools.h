Take any pathname -- simple, relative, or complete -- and split it

code gives some information about the path actually present.
Returns true if there was a directory component to split off.
Returns false if there was no directory component, but in this case,
still fills "dir" with "."
The buffers dir and file must be as big as path.  They are not allocated
by this function.

Take an input string in URL form, and split it into its components.
URLs are of the form "method://server:port/filename".  Any component
that is missing will be recorded as the string with one null character.
If the port is not specified, it is recorded as -1.
The caller should free the resulting strings in method, server, and path.
