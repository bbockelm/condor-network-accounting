/**
This class multiplexes number of UNIX file system calls.
The fd's used to index this table are "virtual file descriptors",
and could refer to real local fds, remote fds, ioservers, sockets,
or who knows what.  It only makes sense to use this table when
MappingFileDescriptors() is in effect.
<p>
This class does several things:
<dir> 
	<li> checks validity of fds  
	<li> multiplexes fds to file objects
	<li> keeps I/O summaries
	<li> manages checkpoint and restore
</dir>

This class does _not_:
<dir>
	<li> Decide whether mapping is in effect.
	     The system call stubs do that.
	<li> Implement read, write, ioctl, etc. for _any_ file.
	     Subclasses of CondorFile do that (condor_file_*.h)
	<li> Implement buffering.
	     A CondorFileBuffer wrapped around a file object does that.
	<li> Perform operations on names (i.e. stat()).
	     Those are handled transparently by the syscall switches.
</dir>

This file table is similar to an in-kernel file table.
It has several sub-structures:
<dir>
<li> CondorFile -- represents a truly-opened file
<li> CondorFilePointer -- represents a seek pointer
<li> CondorFileInfo -- records I/O summares for a file.
</dir>
<p>
Each integer file descriptor (fd) indexes a CondorFilePointer (CFP) in
the open file table.  Each CFP stores a current seek pointer and a 
pointer to a CondorFile (CF) and CondorFileInfo (CFI).
<p>
An open() causes a new CFP, CFI, and CF to be created.  The CFP is installed
in the file table, and the index is returned as a file descriptor.
open("words") would create this:
<pre>

   fd=3
     |
    CFP
    / \
   CF CFI

</pre>
Suppose that another open() is performed on the same file.  This requires
a separate seek pointer be managed, and a new fd be allocated, but the
same file must be manipulated.
<pre>

   fd=3  fd=4
     |     |
    CFP   CFP
     \ \ / /
      \ X /
      CF CFI

<pre>
Suppose that a dup is performed on fd 4.  A new fd must be allocated, but
it will share the same seek pointer as fd 4.
<pre>

   fd=3  fd=4 fd=5
     |     | /
    CFP   CFP
     \ \ / /
      \ X /
      CF CFI

</pre>
A close() on an fd causes the fd to be de-allocated.  It it is the last
reference to a CFP, that is also de-allocated.  If the last CFP to a CF
is de-allocated, the file is closed, and the CF de-allocated.  However,
the CFI is saved and kept in a list.  If the file is opened again, the
same CFI is used for keeping summaries.  CFIs are reported to the
shadow whenever a file is closed or the job terminates.
<p>
When in standalone checkpointing mode, the structure above is
maintained so that we can use the same object and caching sceme.
However, because stubs are not generated for remapping fds, we try
hard to keep the real fds synchronized with the virtual fds.
